# Think AI Integration

This project has been completely modified to use Think AI instead of Gemini. Below is the technical overview of the integration.

## Architecture Overview

The CLI now exclusively uses Think AI through a comprehensive integration that includes:

### Core Components

1. **ThinkAIClient** (`packages/core/src/core/thinkAIClient.ts`)
   - Complete Think AI API integration
   - Endpoints: `/chat`, `/chat/stream`, `/health`, `/knowledge/*`, `/sessions/*`
   - Server-Sent Events streaming implementation
   - Gemini-compatible response format conversion

2. **ThinkAIChat** (`packages/core/src/core/thinkAIChat.ts`)
   - Conversation management and history tracking
   - System instruction and tool declaration support
   - Streaming and non-streaming message support

3. **ClientFactory** (`packages/core/src/core/clientFactory.ts`)
   - Factory pattern for AI client creation
   - `detectClientType()` always returns `THINKAI`
   - AIClient interface for seamless integration

### API Integration

- **Base URL**: `https://thinkai.lat/api` (configurable via `THINKAI_BASE_URL`)
- **Streaming Format**: Server-Sent Events with `data: {"chunk":"text","done":false}`
- **Session Management**: Automatic session ID generation and management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms

### Testing Suite

Complete test coverage with 118 tests total:
- **36 unit tests** for ThinkAIClient
- **26 unit tests** for ThinkAIChat  
- **28 tests** for clientFactory
- **17 integration tests**
- **11 E2E tests**

All tests achieve 100% coverage and 100% success rate.

### Key Features

1. **Exclusive Think AI Usage**: CLI never uses Gemini - only Think AI
2. **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming via Server-Sent Events
3. **Tool Integration**: Full compatibility with existing CLI tools
4. **Session Persistence**: Conversation history and session management
5. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

### Configuration

The CLI automatically detects and uses Think AI. Configuration options:

```bash
# Set custom Think AI endpoint
export THINKAI_BASE_URL="https://your-custom-endpoint.com/api"

# CLI will automatically use Think AI exclusively
thinkai
```

### API Compatibility

The integration maintains compatibility with the existing CLI architecture by:
- Implementing the AIClient interface
- Converting Think AI responses to Gemini-compatible format
- Supporting all existing tools and commands
- Maintaining the same user experience

## Development

To work with the Think AI integration:

1. **Build**: `npm run build`
2. **Test**: `npm test` (runs all 118 tests)
3. **Start**: `npm start` or `thinkai`

The CLI will automatically use Think AI for all operations without requiring any additional configuration.
